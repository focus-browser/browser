## A note on maintenance

This project will never make it past alpha, nor will it receive any bug fixes or new features that do not directly affect me (@trickypr). I am putting my energy towards [a project using a different approach](https://github.com/pulse-browser/experiment). For a rough guide to my reasoning, see [this Mastodon post](https://mas.to/@trickypr/111328440028458478).

## 👨‍💻 Install

We (Pulse-Browser developers) support building open source software personally for security and comfort reasons. Although this is an option, we also have prebuilt installers available on our [Releases](https://github.com/pulse-browser/browser/releases) page.

## 🐛 Bugs, Support and Chat

For bug reports, support, and just having a friendly chat with the team, feel free to join the discord at https://discord.gg/xNkretH7sD or create an issue on the GitHub repository.

## 📋 Goals

- Minimalist ui that feels more native than firefox's (custom skin, not a rewrite)
- Replace some internal firefox components with better open source alternatives (e.g. uBlock origin)
- Remove mozilla's telemetry, ads and pocket
